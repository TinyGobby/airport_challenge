As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

```
load './lib/airport.rb'
airport = Airport.new
plane = Plane.new
airport.land(plane) == [plane]
```

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

```
load './lib/airport.rb'
airport = Airport.new
plane = Plane.new
airport.land(plane)
airport.takeoff(plane) == plane
airport.hangar == [] # true
```

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

```
load './lib/airport.rb'
plane = Plane.new
weather = Weather.new
# when weather.stormy? = true
airport = Airport.new(Airport::DEFAULT_CAPACITY, weather, [plane])
airport.takeoff(plane) # error
```

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

```
load './lib/airport.rb'
airport = Airport.new
airport.land(Plane.new)
airport.land(Plane.new) # RuntimeError (Airport full)
```
As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

```
load './lib/airport.rb'
stansted = Airport.new
stansted.capacity == 1
stansted.land(Plane.new)
stansted.land(Plane.new) # RuntimeError (Airport full)
heathrow = Airport.new(50)
heathrow.capacity == 50
50.times { heathrow.land(Plane.new) }
heathrow.land(plane) # Runtime Error (Airport full)
```


Edge Cases:

* Planes can only take off from airports they are in
* Planes that are already flying cannot takeoff
* Planes that are landed cannot land again
