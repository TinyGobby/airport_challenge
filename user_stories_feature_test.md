As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

  load './lib/plane.rb'
  airport = Airport.new
  plane = Plane.new
  airport.land(plane) == [plane]

So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

  load './lib/plane.rb'
  airport = Airport.new
  plane = Plane.new
  airport.land(plane)
  airport.takeoff(plane) == plane
  airport.hangar == [] # true

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

  when weather = stormy
  plane.takeoff # error

  when weather = stormy
  airport.land(plane) # error

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

  when airport.full?
  airport.land(plane) # error

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

  airport = Airport.new(default_capacity_that_can_be_changed)
